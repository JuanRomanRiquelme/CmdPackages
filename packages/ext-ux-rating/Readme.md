# ext-ux-rating

This package contains the `rating` widget. The `rating` widget is designed to
display a numeric rating using glyphs and allow the user to change the value
by clicking or tapping on the desired rating.

## Basic Usage

The `rating` widget can be used in standard containers:

    Ext.create({
        xtype: 'panel',
        width: 200,
        renderTo: Ext.getBody(),
        layout: {
            type: 'vbox',
            align: 'stretch'
        },
        items: [{
            xtype: 'rating',
            value: 3
        }]
    });

The example application shows several differently configured instances:
